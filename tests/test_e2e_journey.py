"""
One full, realistic user journey through the REAL gateway (localhost:8080)
with a REAL Bearer JWT throughout - unlike test_history_routes.py's
live_server/X-Gateway-Secret shortcut (which fakes gateway auth by hitting
a locally-spun-up handler directly), every HTTP call here goes through the
actual nginx container, njs JWT verification included. MQTT goes over the
real compose-managed broker, picked up by the REAL mqtt_listener/
fault_detector/derivation_engine daemon containers - not synthetic
in-process calls like test_ingest.py's/test_fault_detector.py's/
test_derivation_engine.py's own unit-style tests.

Journey: create org+admin -> login -> publish a real MQTT reading -> read
it back via GET /ingest/history -> tag equipment into the RDF graph
(RemoteStore, no auth - same as scripts/seed_derivations_and_faults.py) ->
create a formula derivation over that equipment -> wait for the real
derivation_engine daemon to compute it -> create a fault rule + webhook ->
re-publish an out-of-range reading -> confirm the real fault_detector
daemon opens a fault and delivers a signed webhook to a receiver this test
stands up.

Needs `docker compose up -d` (gateway, auth_api, ingest_api, fault_api,
fault_detector, derivation_api, derivation_engine, postgres, oxigraph,
mosquitto all healthy) with TIMBERDOODLE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_WEBHOOKS=1 already
set for fault_api/fault_detector - see CLAUDE.md.
