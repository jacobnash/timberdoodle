"""
Regression test for scripts/seed_derivations_and_faults.py - a demo
script with zero coverage of its own effects until this file. Runs the
real script as a subprocess against the real gateway/derivation_api/
fault_api (same shape as test_gateway_auth.py: no in-process way to
exercise the real njs-enforced gateway, so this hits localhost:8080 for
real), then verifies its documented effects actually landed: the 4
derivations + 4 fault rules exist, and - not just "the row exists" - one
derivation (zone-temp-deviation) actually evaluates to a real computed
value when real matching graph/point_history data is present.

--skip-structure is passed deliberately: seed_site_structure() only acts
on urn:equip:fbf/ahu-*/vav-*/meter-* equipment that a real fbf ingest run
would have created, which this stack doesn't have running. Without
--skip-structure it degrades to a harmless no-op (prints "skipping..."),
so passing it just keeps this test from depending on unrelated ingest
state either way - it doesn't change what's being tested here (the
derivations/fault-rules POSTs, which don't depend on seed_site_structure
having run).
