"""
Real end-to-end test against the real gateway container - njs only runs
inside real nginx, so unlike every other integration test in this repo
(which hits already-running infra like Postgres/Oxigraph directly via
connect()), there's no in-process way to fake this. Same precondition as
every other @pytest.mark.integration test here: `docker compose up -d`
first (see CLAUDE.md) - this file doesn't start containers itself, it
just hits the real gateway at localhost:8080, matching how e.g.
test_faults.py assumes Postgres is already up rather than starting it.

Needs the `gateway` and `auth_api` services (and whichever backend a
given test targets) actually running with real
TIMBERDOODLE_JWT_SECRET/TIMBERDOODLE_GATEWAY_SECRET set - `docker
compose up -d` now refuses to start the gateway at all without both
(see .env.example), so there's no more "blank secret" case to worry
about.
