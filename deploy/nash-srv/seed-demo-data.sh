# One-time (not per-deploy) population of the public demo with real
# equipment/points/history data, instead of an empty app past the login
# screen. Run once, on nash-srv, after docker-compose.fbf.yml's services
# are up (i.e. after a deploy that includes them):
#
#   cd ~/timberdoodle-deploy/deploy/nash-srv && bash seed-demo-data.sh
#
# (or from the actual runner workspace - anywhere docker compose can see
# the same project). Safe-ish to re-run: provisioning/autotag are meant to
# be re-run as new equipment/points show up, but seed_derivations_and_faults.py
# POSTs new derivation/rule definitions every time - re-running it creates
# duplicates, so this script only runs it if TIMBERDOODLE_ADMIN_EMAIL has
# no derivations yet.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Tells fbf.api to start polling the mock BACnet device and publish
#      its ~500 points to MQTT (fbf/mock_hospital's site spec, baked into
#      the fbf image at build time).
#   2. Waits for timberdoodle's mqtt_listener (already running) to have
#      actually ingested some of that.
#   3. Runs autotag (rule engine only, --no-llm - no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
#      needed) so points get classified into Brick equipment/point
#      classes - derivations/fault rules below only fire against tagged
#      points.
#   4. Seeds real Brick derivations + fault rules
#      (scripts/seed_derivations_and_faults.py), using the same demo
#      admin account already in GitHub Actions secrets.
