# One-shot bootstrap for the timberdoodle deploy on nash-srv. Run this
# ON nash-srv, as jacob (it sudos itself where needed - don't run the
# whole thing as root):
#
#   git clone git@github.com:jacobnash/timberdoodle.git   # skip if already cloned
#   cd timberdoodle
#   bash deploy/nash-srv/bootstrap.sh <RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN>
#
# Get <RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN> from:
#   https://github.com/jacobnash/timberdoodle/settings/actions/runners/new
# (valid ~1 hour, single use - grab it right before running this).
#
# What this does, in order:
#   1. Runs setup-runner.sh (creates the github-runner user if needed,
#      generates real prod secrets straight into that user's own home so
#      the deploy wrapper's --env-file path is guaranteed to match -
#      skipped if that file already exists, installs the root-owned deploy
#      wrapper + scoped sudoers rule, registers and starts the runner).
#   2. Appends timberdoodle's Caddy block to /etc/caddy/Caddyfile (skipped
#      if already present) and reloads Caddy.
#
# Does NOT touch DNS - add the two CNAMEs from
# docs-site/pages/nash-srv-deploy.mdx yourself first, in your DNS
# provider's UI (needs credentials this script doesn't have).
