"""
The one piece of auth code every backend needs, and no more: confirm a
request actually came through the gateway (which sets this header after
its own js_access role/site/rate-limit checks pass - see
gateway/njs/main.js) rather than hitting this container's port directly
from a sibling on the same compose network. Not a second trust boundary
or a place for real authz logic - the gateway is still the only place
that decides who can do what.
