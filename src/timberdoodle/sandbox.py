"""
Runtime-submitted Python, sandboxed - a derivation's fn_source is arbitrary
code accepted over HTTP (derivation_api.py), not a developer's PR. This is
the whole mitigation surface for that: an AST denylist (rejects the
constructs that let restricted-builtins sandboxes get escaped, e.g.
`().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()`), a builtins allowlist, and a
wall-clock timeout. None of this is a hard security boundary - only OS-level
isolation (subprocess-per-execution, gVisor, WASM) would be that, and that's
deliberately out of scope for the single-trusted-operator deployment this
targets. See derivation-api-openapi.yaml's security caveat.

Timeout is a plain daemon thread, not signal.alarm or ThreadPoolExecutor:
cur-mode derivations get evaluated from the MQTT callback thread, and
signal.alarm/setitimer only work on the interpreter's main thread - raises
ValueError anywhere else. ThreadPoolExecutor was tried first and rejected -
its worker threads aren't daemon threads, so a genuinely stuck submission
(e.g. a submitted infinite loop) blocks the executor's atexit shutdown
handler forever, hanging the whole process at exit, not just that one call.
A plain daemon=True thread doesn't have that problem.
