"""
Generic JSON-file config persistence - lifted verbatim from
fbf/src/fbf/connection_store.py (same operation on a different file, not a
near-duplicate situation, so sharing it directly is the right amount of
DRY here). A JSON file, not sqlite3: this project's config stores
(rules.json, webhooks.json) are each written by exactly one process, so
there's no concurrent-writer problem for sqlite3's transactions to solve,
and the payload (a handful of dicts) has no schema advantage over "a list
of dicts, in a file."

Known, accepted gap: no file locking - single writer per file is an
assumption, not enforced. Fine per YAGNI unless multi-process writes to
the same file are actually needed.
