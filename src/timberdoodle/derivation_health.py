"""
Per-(derivation, target) failure isolation - same shape as faults.py's
webhook_health, keyed differently. A derivation's fn returning cleanly, even
with a value that's semantically wrong, is a success here: that's the
derivation author's data-quality problem, not something this module judges.
Only an uncaught exception anywhere in evaluating one target - the sandboxed
fn call, a read_range/write failure, a malformed SPARQL row - counts as a
failure. Past disable_threshold consecutive failures, that one
(derivation_id, target_uri) pair is skipped by derivation_engine.py until a
human clears it via enable_target().
