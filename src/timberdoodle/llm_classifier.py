"""
LLM fallback classifier for points/equip the rule engine (mapping.py) can't
place - a chillers/boilers/meters problem, not a temp-sensor problem: those
equipment families have zero rule coverage in rules/haystack_to_brick.yaml
and rules/haystack_equip_to_brick.yaml today.

Deliberately its own module, not folded into mapping.py: mapping.py has zero
dependency on `anthropic` and keeps working (and keeps its existing tests
green) whether or not this module is ever imported. See
mapping.classify_point_with_fallback for the integration point - it takes
this module's classify_with_llm as an injected callable, never imports it
directly.
